# Symbols over Souls- The Existentialist’s Guide to Outrage Management

We often hear it said that committing bigger crimes can actually let you off the hook than committing the ones, that are smaller, as on the latter ones, you’ll get scapegoated left and right, without a doubt. I mean if you look at the instances nowadays, sentiments are weaponized without any consideration to mess with the guys who cause matters that are trivial and people build connections in every case, to get out of trouble, but here’s the kicker — what would happen if you accidentally hurt the egos of big shots, who occupy the highest positions, who are right at the top? And what if the smaller folks haven’t fully, yet, sold their souls yet? Even if they avoid becoming those gross, manipulative monsters, they have to pay, today or tomorrow. They’ll drain every last drop of your humanity, that are left, turn you into someone worse, and this cycle? Man, it just never stops.

Let’s imagine, a bus accident kills two children. Driver’s at fault — reckless driving. However, mere moments before the disaster, a group of random men onboard was engaged in laughter and mockery, making severe critical remarks about a certain religious belief. However, when all of this was happening, one individual, amid the chaos, to act on his first thought at that moment, recorded this scene. Soon that clip went viral, drawing more attention than the tragic loss of innocent lives. However, ordinary people are seen to be more bothered to focus on what provides them with meaning, purpose, belonging, and peace, topics related to religion, that was how it was the people of the society. Rightfully so, when those two lives were alive, were they contributing to any of that? Why, then, should the masses mourn their loss, right? Hah\! Do these individuals, sometimes I wonder, truly push beyond their cognitive limits, to ignore indications of reality that are slightest, at such moments? Or do they reserve their reflections, for whatever purpose, for later?

Here’s the truth: we have become desensitized, a state that no one, having a clear conscience of themselves, can deny. People would often react with more outrage at a cockroach being fed ice cream, only to be killed, rather than the murder of a human being just moments away. How sick\! Also had I used a butterfly, it would have evoked, serving skewed compassion of a deeper well, an empathy that is more evident. That’s very much like a lizard, suddenly, unexpectedly falling directly into the milk would be considered a far greater tragedy than the news of yet another farmer, burdened with debt, taking their own life. Who thinks about a cockroach? Disgusting, truly, nobody. A farmer? Just another cold statistic. We’re so disconnected from our own humanity that a bloody bug’s last meal tugs compassion more than the screaming, crying out of desperation, actual human beings. It’s like… their pain becomes this distant, abstract thing — “eh, happens all the time.” To be honest, I don’t mind commenting bitingly on this self-centeredness.

Imagine if those children had worn garments that had “Jesus loves you” written over them. The focus would have shifted, significantly, toward them. The driver, until now, who was a figure of just an unfortunate circumstance in the first scene, the fate of a victim for which he could hardly be made accountable, is now a villain, a desecrator of the sacred. As death confronts any of us, should not these distinctions fade into the background? Let’s go back, for a moment, to 2015, when a male lion, named Cecil, was shot and killed by an American dentist, then, the whole world focused on Cecil specifically, obscuring, the very fact that countless other animals die every day due to various conflicts. The same we witness when wildfire happens. If a tiger is killed in the blaze, he becomes a martyr, despite countless other creatures who are vulnerable, also dying along with him, with relentlessness. We mourn the symbol, the idea of the Bagheera (the tiger), then the forest itself. We are speaking of children — innocent and vulnerable, capable of love and dreams. So why’s a shirt a line between the shared grief for both? It’s an irony, a garment, what is meant to unite can also divide. In reality, we’d weep harder for the symbol than the actual tragedy.

Now let’s crank it up even more, shall we? What if the driver wore an inverted cross, and joked about satanism? Yep, the outrage would instantly be redirected. The mockery clip? Trivialized. Classic move right? The bigger “threat” eats the spotlight. Are we sure we’re not watching a Bollywood potboiler in real life? I remember watching “Chichhore” last time, at first it was all academic pressure, then bam — suicide attempt. It’s funny how closing the laptop, all I remember is the grand tragedy, easily forgetting the pressure, caused by the system itself, drove someone to such desperation — just another Tuesday in Bollywood, and apparently, in life too. We have yet to confront the manipulation at play where narratives are curated to promote the propaganda of those in power — the truths they wish to bury for a time.

Furthermore, Often we let ourselves drown in carefully crafted and selectively presented news. Why though? They only overwhelm our senses and numbs critical thinking, much like the cockroach approaching that deadly ice cream, before the stomp. Like a child being spoon-fed, we are spoon-fed The Little Mermaid fairy tales, presented carefully, and selectively. Its immediacy draws our attention like moths to a flame. We are, pretty tragically, at their fingertips, and, what is worse, subtly and slowly manipulated into adopting a pseudo-reality that seeks to control, not inform.

In recent years, amidst more and more news online, the speed at which we digest them has reached alarming levels. Petty minds of ours, race across headlines, like rapid-fire, rendering us quick to judge without understanding the full context. We judge even before we understand, and scroll to the next before we reflect. Who exactly asked us to be instant 2-minute noodle analysts? Who demands immediate wisdom in a world that rarely provides straightforward answers? Because, unlike those cockroaches, we can always pause and whisper, “Wait….does this actually make sense?” If you’re wondering, taste that sugar, but taste the doubt, too.

Now imagine this: at that spot, after hours have passed, those two souls, still weeping, still crying out, Why couldn’t he have been more careful? Why did this happen? Sitting there, invisible, watching their own lifeless bodies, unable to hold each other’s hands, unable to wake themselves up. Whilst all of this happening, they finally respond to the noise, coming not from afar, of a group of people, gathered at the nearby shop. They are, however, not talking about them, no, they are gossiping about the driver, the viral clip, those disturbed minds — about how daring, insensitive they were. “Did you see the video with full volume? Did you hear all of it that they were discussing? How dare they think of involving Jesus in it?”

And the souls, looking at their dead bodies, their tears now dry, look at those favorite necklaces — tiny crucifixes, gifts from their parents, told never to take them off, now stained with blood. They wonder: if only those necklaces were bigger, if only they were more noticeable, maybe, maybe then someone would have seen them, and would have asked, “How could the driver let blood touch those crucifixes?” Maybe then, someone would have talked about us, more.

To remember the words from “The Stranger” by Albert Camus, “Gentlemen of the jury, the defendant’s lack of remorse, his coldness in the face of his mother’s death — these are crimes far worse than the murder of a man\!” And that is what we do. As the driver wore the inverted cross, we condemn him for that, more than anything, more than the recklessness that caused the end of those two lives. “I accuse this man of burying his mother with a criminal heart” — the same way we mourn the tiger, ignore the forest, judge the shirt, judge those people in the bus who were mocking the religion but forget those children, the recklessness of the driver.

But no. The souls fade. And the world moves, steadily on.
